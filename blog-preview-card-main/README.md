- Mobile-first workflow

- I practiced using Flexbox to center the card on the page and align the author's name and avatar.
- I implemented hover states on the card's title to make it interactive.
- I learned how to properly link a CSS file and a Google Font to my HTML document.

### Continued development

- I want to continue learning more about CSS properties and responsive design.
- I plan to practice using CSS Grid for more complex layouts in future projects.
- I will explore JavaScript to add more functionality to my projects.
